\chapter{\label{text:Kap4}Conclusions}

This report showed an implementation of a method to measure the bottleneck link rate. There, a timeout function was considered and the right value of the bottleneck link rate was decided to be 950 kbps. Good measurements were detected with a packet size of 1500 bytes. Another option to increase the performance of this implementation would be to check the right order of the two packets. This order can be changed with UDP connection and the measurement of the time difference is wrong. Additionally, it could be considered to check plausibility of the results. If the link rate was measured earlier to be a 1024 kbps DSL connection, capacities of 20000 kbps should be categorized to be implausible. Consequently a maximum bound could be created based on former measurements and known information about the network. Another option to get more accurate results is to adapt the histogram accuracy.
