replacing int with float: 11882 cycles
with int: 11228 cycles
replacing short with float: 12890 cycles

We deal with a fixed-point hardware, that means that floating-point operations are emulated in software. Moreover, the memory acces latency comes into discussion: because float variables are allocated much more memory than integer variables, the operations with float data types are slower than the integer ones.
