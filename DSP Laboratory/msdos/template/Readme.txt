This template can be used for each individual assignment. The only thing which needs to be adapted is the project directory " ProjectDir="H:\dsp_lab\" " in the dsp_lab.pjt file (can be changed with the editor). The reference should point straight into the project directory. This directory should always have a name like a221 for assignment two task two exercise one to make it more convenient for us to find the individual solutions.
